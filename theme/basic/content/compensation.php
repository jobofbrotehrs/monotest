                    At their best, employee rewards programs help you get the most out of your people and recruit and

                    When they’re not working, they can interfere with your ability to deliver on your business and people goals. <br/>
                    They also help you spend your money wisely, so you’re getting returns on what you’re investing in your people.<br/>
                    But many businesses struggle to get it right. Budgets are tight, business and people strategies evolve, regulations 
                    vary within and across geographies, and you need to know your markets inside and out to stay competitive.

                    Having a partner with insights and expertise on pay, benefits, incentives and reward programs can help 
                    you create and manage a fair and equitable program that really pays off. One that’s tailored to your company 
                    so that you can attract and retain the talent that your business needs.

                    Rewards are intended to motivate staff. Rewards can include cash, bonuses, commissions, 
                    extra paid time off, gift cards, gym memberships, commuting or parking passes, or other tangible 
                    benefits. Effective rewards systems lay out the steps needed to earn the rewards, announce the 
                    rewards employees can earn, and give dates and deadlines for performing the work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be careful not to set targets that take a considerable amount of work, where an employee 
                    gets nothing if she falls short by a small amount.

                    In addition to offering tangible rewards, give employee awards. 
                    These can include employee of the week/month/year, most-improved employee, or top-performer recognition. 
                    Make the awards public by announcing them in your company newsletter, on your website, or with an office memo or email blast.
                    Not every award has to be formal. Encourage managers to provide one-on-one morale 
                    boosts to subordinates using written notes, a free lunch or a half-day off if the employee has performed
                    above and beyond. For example, someone who works late every night one week to help the company meet a project 
                    deadline might be given a public shoutout and Friday off.

                    One of the biggest complaints with many employee <br/>
                    rewards programs is that they aren’t fair, which leads <br/>
                    to frustration, morale problems and employee defections. <br/>
                    For example, if a manager picks the employee of the <br/>
                    month or year, that can lead to charges of favoritism.<br/>
                    Make sure any employee rewards you offer come <br/>
                    with specific criteria you announce in advance. <br/>
                    This allows employees to work toward earning their <br/>
                    rewards and shows that any decisions you made <br/>
                    were based on the criteria you announced in <br/>
                    advance.
