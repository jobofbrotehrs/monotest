                    Employer branding is a company's outward message <br/>

                    It serves two major purposes:<br/>
                    first, to attract new talent <br/>
                    by enhancing the appeal of belonging;<br/>
                    second (and most importantly), to retain existing <br/>

                                Usually, HR is the first one that comes to mind when we think about employer branding strategies. 
                                And this is correct if we refer to the official actions a company is taking to build and promote its employer brand. 
                                But, employer brand is not something you choose – it is what you are. 
                            </span>
                            <span>
                                And your identity as a company is shaped by various stakeholders:
                                The founders or business owners, the CEO and all C-suite executives who have a strategic vision
                                for the company and set the values they want to reinforce
                                The line managers who lead, evaluate and train their team members
                                The HR team that manages employee relations and establishes company policies
                                The marketing team that communicates company news externally (e.g. via social media, events, etc.)
                                All of these stakeholders can play a part in how their company is perceived among job seekers, but, to build a strong 
                                employer brand, they need to work together. For example, the marketing team can’t promote how happy their colleagues 
                                are enjoying benefits such as bonuses and flexible working hours unless the senior management approves those
                                benefits and HR implements them.

                                Another distinction we need to make is between employer brand and company brand. 
                                Those two terms should not be confused: the former indicates your reputation as an employer for
                                job candidates whereas the latter indicates your reputation as a company in general.
                                In this employer branding definition, when we talk about “brand” we refer solely to a company’s reputation as an employer.
                                Although they’re different, one can impact the other. A company with a strong brand is usually an attractive place to work. 
                                On the other hand, a company that has a negative employer brand might discourage people (or other companies) from becoming customers.

                                It’s easier to understand the importance of employer 
                                branding if we think of employers with a good reputation. 
                                Companies with a strong employer brand:
                            </span>

                                without having to spend too much, since employees
                                proactively apply to companies they know they have
                                a nice work environment.

                                The first step is to be a good employer and the second step is to promote what you’re doing as an employer externally.<br/> 
                                To become a good employer, you need to think about how you treat those who interact with your company, whether
                                you’ve hired them or not. For example:<br/>
                                Design an inclusive hiring process, where all job seekers have equal opportunities to get hired regardless of protected 
                                characteristics or background.<br/>
                                Respect candidates’ time by evaluating their candidacy objectively and replying to them promptly.<br/>
                                Craft fair company policies to ensure all employees feel safe, comfortable and valued at work.<br/>
                                Provide compensation and benefits that motivate employees and help them balance their work with their personal life.<br/>
                                Build career development plans, so that employees can grow their skills and develop professionally within your company.<br/>
                                While working on creating a healthy work environment, you can also design employer branding campaigns to promote your 
                                company. Here are a few ideas:<br/>
                                Share pictures of your workspaces and group gatherings on social media.<br/>
                                Build engaging careers pages where candidates can learn more about your work life.<br/>
                                Give voice to your employees (through videos, testimonials, Instagram etc.) so they can share their unique experiences 
                                while working with you.
                                Host career days at your offices where job seekers can see first-hand 
                                what it’s like working at your company.

                                Employer branding is the single most important factor in attracting and retaining quality employees.
                                A company's reputation as an employer can make or break them, so it pays off for businesses to invest
                                time into building up their own brand value with workers who are crucial members of your success!
